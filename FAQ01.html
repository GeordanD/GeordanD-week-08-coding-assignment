        <p>
          A color cast is an unwanted tint in the image due to the lighting, the
          white balance of the camera and mixed lighting situations,<br />
          for example if you have the lights on in a room but you also have
          lighting coming in from <br />
          Color casts are not usually uniform across an entire image. Often,
          color casts are stronger in one portion of the image <br />
          (such as the highlights) and weaker or nonexistent in others (the
          shadows, for example).
        </p>
        <p>
          This causes the image to look a color that the room is not in person.
        </p>

          Here at ChaseCapture, we go over the images with great detail, making
          them look as true as the room looks in real life!

              This is the before picture. Notice the colors are so off that even
              the doors look yellow.

            <figcaption>
              Here is after I changed the color cast. Notice how all the oranges
              and yellows are gone and the doors look as white as they would be
              in person.
